Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization
----------------------------------------------------

An interactive user-friendly web page that allows users to see what data standards exist for high-value municipal open datasets (e.g. real time transit data). This code is associated with Geothink's Open Data Standards Project (http://geothink.ca/open-data-standards-for-improving-city-governance/).

What is Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization provides an interactive web page that municipal workers can use to assess a variety of standards for high-value municipal open datasets while also comparing dataset properties from Geothink's five partnered cities' high-value datasets to see any discrepencies that exist between guidelines in a standard (e.g. differences in file formats). The five partnered cities include the following: City of Vancouver, BC, City of Toronto, ON, City of Surrey, BC, City of Edmonton, AB, and City of Ottawa, ON. Data is pulled from two different Fusion Tables that were modified from two original dashboards. The original two dashboards and their descriptions can be accessed via this link: http://geothink.ca/open-data-standards-for-improving-city-governance/. These two original dashboards are difficult to use by municipal open data employees, thus this visualization aims to rework the dashboards into a more user-friendly and interactive tool. Currently the two Fusion Tables are inaccessible to the public as this visualization is still a work in progress.

Documentation
-------------

All code in the index.html is commented. Documentation regarding the visualization can also be accessed via the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdxI1uLEMevz6e7WFPQrRa4ja_toXyMETiVcEkxixEQ/edit?usp=sharing


Installation
------------

As this project is still in its early steps, there is no website URL to access the visualization; rather, if you download the entire file onto your Desktop and then run the python -m SimpleHTTPServer (http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python), the visualization can be accessed and used.

Please email julia.conzon@mail.mcgill.ca if you have any questions or comments regarding the code. As this visualization is still incomplete, any feedback would be great.
