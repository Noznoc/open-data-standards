Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization
----------------------------------------------------

An interactive user-friendly web page that allows users to see what data standards exist for high-value municipal open datasets (e.g., real time transit data). This code is associated with Geothink's Open Data Standards Project (http://geothink.ca/open-data-standards-for-improving-city-governance/).

What is Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization provides an interactive web page that municipal workers can use to assess a variety of standards for high-value municipal open datasets while also comparing dataset properties from Geothink's five partnered cities' high-value datasets to see any discrepencies that exist between guidelines in a standard (e.g. differences between what file formats the City of Edmonton's General Building Permits dataset has versus the file format requirements for Building & Land Development Specification (BLDS)). The five partnered cities include the following: City of Vancouver, BC, City of Toronto, ON, City of Surrey, BC, City of Edmonton, AB, and City of Ottawa, ON. Data is pulled from two different Fusion Tables that were modified from two original dashboards. The original two dashboards and their descriptions can be accessed via this link: http://geothink.ca/open-data-standards-for-improving-city-governance/. These two original dashboards are difficult to use by municipal open data employees, thus this visualization aims to rework the dashboards into a more user-friendly and interactive tool. Currently the two Fusion Tables are inaccessible to the public as this visualization is still a work in progress.
