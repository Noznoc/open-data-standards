Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization
----------------------------------------------------

An interactive user-friendly web page that allows users to see what data standards exist for high-value municipal open datasets (e.g., real time transit data). This visualization is associated with Geothink's Open Data Standards Project (http://geothink.ca/open-data-standards-for-improving-city-governance/).

What is Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Geothink's Open Data Standards Project Visualization provides an interactive web page that municipal workers can use to assess a variety of standards for high-value municipal open datasets while also comparing dataset properties from Geothink's six partnered cities' high-value datasets to see any discrepencies that exist between guidelines in a standard (e.g. differences between what file formats the City of Edmonton's General Building Permits dataset has versus the file format requirements for Building & Land Development Specification (BLDS)). The siz partnered cities include the following: City of Vancouver, BC, City of Toronto, ON, City of Surrey, BC, City of Edmonton, AB, City of Montreal, QC, and City of Ottawa, ON. Data is pulled from two different Fusion Tables that were modified from two original dashboards. The original two dashboards and their descriptions can be accessed via this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wcUhE6waDz0RPT81E5aebcJf58AH92FstMZQKy5kRc/edit?usp=sharing. These two original dashboards are difficult to use by municipal open data employees, thus this visualization aims to rework the dashboards into a more user-friendly and interactive tool.

Update (September 7th, 2016): The visualization now supports crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing includes the following features: users can submit additional standards to the database, users can request an update/revision of an existing standard in the database, users can submit additional municipal datasets to the database, and users can request an update/revision of an existing municipal dataset in the database. More details are covered in the manual (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wcUhE6waDz0RPT81E5aebcJf58AH92FstMZQKy5kRc/edit?usp=sharing).
